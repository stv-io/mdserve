# mdserve

Markdown preview server for AI coding agents.

This fork is maintained at [stv-io/mdserve](https://github.com/stv-io/mdserve).
Its releases include H1-based browser tab titles and an MP favicon.

Follow along as your AI agent writes markdown, rendered live in the browser
instead of raw text in the terminal.

## Features

**Zero config.** `mdserve file.md` just works. No config files, no flags
required, no setup steps.

**Single binary.** One statically-compiled executable. Install it and forget
about it. No runtime dependencies to manage.

**Instant live reload.** File changes appear in the browser immediately via
WebSocket. This is the core interaction: an agent writes, a human reads.

**Ephemeral sessions.** Start it during a coding session, kill it when you're
done. mdserve is not a long-running server and doesn't need to be.

**Agent-friendly content.** Full GFM support (tables, task lists, code blocks),
Mermaid diagrams, and directory mode with sidebar navigation - the kinds of
content AI coding agents actually produce.

## What mdserve is not

- **Not a documentation site generator.** Use mdBook, Docusaurus, or MkDocs
  for that.
- **Not a static site server** or something you deploy to production.
- **Not a general-purpose markdown authoring tool** with heavy customization
  for manual writing workflows.

## Installation

### macOS and Linux binaries

Download a binary for your operating system and architecture from this fork's
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/stv-io/mdserve/releases/latest),
make it executable, and place it in a directory on your `PATH`.

Homebrew, Arch packages, and `cargo install mdserve` refer to the original
upstream project; they do not install this fork's changes.

### Linux

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stv-io/mdserve/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will automatically detect your platform and install the latest binary to your system.

### Alternative Methods

#### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/stv-io/mdserve --tag v1.2.0 --locked
```

#### Nix Package Manager

``` bash
nix profile install github:stv-io/mdserve
```

#### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stv-io/mdserve.git
cd mdserve
cargo build --release
cp target/release/mdserve <folder in your PATH>
```

#### Manual Download

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/stv-io/mdserve/releases/latest).

## Claude Code Plugin

mdserve includes a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md)
that teaches the agent when and how to launch markdown previews during coding
sessions. With the plugin installed, Claude Code will automatically serve
markdown files when the content benefits from rendered presentation (tables,
diagrams, long documents) and skip the preview for short responses that read
fine in the terminal.

### Install the plugin

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin install mdserve@mdserve
```

This installs to user scope by default (available across all projects). To
install at a different scope:

```
/plugin install mdserve@mdserve --scope project   # for all collaborators
/plugin install mdserve@mdserve --scope local      # for yourself in this repo
```

> **Note:** The `mdserve` binary must also be installed on your system (see
> [Installation](#installation) above).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Serve a single markdown file on default port (3000)
mdserve README.md

# Serve all markdown files in a directory
mdserve docs/

# Serve markdown files in nested directories
mdserve docs/ --recursive

# Serve nested documentation and open it automatically
mdserve docs/ --recursive --open

# Serve on custom port
mdserve README.md --port 8080
mdserve docs/ -p 8080

# Serve on custom hostname and port
mdserve README.md --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Open in browser automatically
mdserve README.md --open
```

### Single-File vs Directory Mode

**Single-File Mode**: When you pass a file path, mdserve serves that specific markdown file with a clean, focused view.

**Directory Mode**: When you pass a directory path, mdserve automatically:
- Scans and serves all `.md` and `.markdown` files in that directory
- Displays a navigation sidebar for easy switching between files
- Watches for new markdown files added to the directory
- Only monitors the immediate directory (non-recursive)

Add `--recursive` to include markdown files below the directory at any depth.
The sidebar groups files by relative directory, and links preserve their full
relative paths. Recursive discovery skips hidden files and directories,
paths excluded by `.gitignore` or `.ignore`, and symbolic links. These rules
apply at startup and when discovering new files or moved-in folders, including
outside Git repositories. Ignore-file edits do not automatically remove
already tracked files; restart the server to apply changed rules to all files.
A directory with no visible markdown files still produces the startup error.

All discovered documents are rendered into memory, so use a focused docs
directory for large repositories. As in flat mode, permanent deletions and
renames can leave cached sidebar entries until restart; this preserves live
preview during editors' temporary rename-and-replace saves.

Without `--recursive`, directory mode remains flat and scans only the
immediate directory.


## Themes

Five built-in themes (light, dark, and Catppuccin variants) accessible from the
theme picker in the top-right corner. Your choice persists across sessions.

## Documentation

For detailed information about mdserve's internal architecture, design decisions, and how it works under the hood, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain compatible with the locked dependencies (2021 edition)

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run recursive-mode regression tests (tests live inline in src/app.rs)
cargo test recursive
```

## Contributing

Contributions should enhance the agent-companion workflow. The best PRs improve
rendering of content that agents produce (code blocks, diagrams, tables, math),
make live reload more robust, or refine the zero-config experience. Features
that push mdserve toward being a documentation platform or a configurable server
are out of scope.

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`,
`fix:`, `chore:`, etc.). All commits are automatically validated against this
format in CI. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
